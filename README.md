# Titanic Survival Predition
This Jupyter Notebook uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is sourced from Kaggle. It includes features like passenger class, age, gender, family size, and fare, which are used to predict survival.

## Model Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
   * The model is used to classify passenger survival and is evaluated on accuracy, with a confusion matrix to visualize performance.

## Structure
1. Data Loading - Loads the dataset and briefly explores its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing - Handles missing values and performs feature engineering.
3. Model Training - Trains a Decision Tree classifier to predict survival.
4. Evaluation - Evaluates model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.
2. Adjust model parameters as needed to experiment with different configurations.

## Results
The model performance is measured using accuracy scores and visualized with a confusion matrix heatmap.
